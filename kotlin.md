# Kotlin

## The ROOT way

This is the way everyone in the Programmer Nullposting group says is the best.

```
fun isEven(num : Int) : Boolean {
    return num % 2 == 0
}
```

## The NUTELLA way
Contibuted by: [Dautomne_](https://github.com/FernandoNSC5)

Because I like nuteLla.

```
fun main() {
    val isEven = { x: Int -> x % 2 == 0 }
    println(isEven(2))
}
```
